‘… about ten thousand should be enough, in cash of course, and she will be returned. Do you wonder at all, how she feels as nothing more than an object to you once  aga-’

You fold the soggy letter back into your jacket pocket as the lonely street light flickers above – too dim to read. Strange how a certain combination of words can etch themselves into your brain like invasive patterns repeating, compulsive. The woods creak with a gentle wind whispering while you wait in trepidation to enter, to leave the safety of your parked car. Somewhere a coder works at a computer, typing away to update an online map of the world and this region – once again leaving this spot blank. This is nowhere.

Through the gnarled thicket, you see the slick stone of an old mansion, glistening in the moonlight. The rust gates of the grounds have ceded into the earth and you shove your way through, onto smashed-up mossy cobble. Faded graffiti heralds the entrance. Despite the dilapidation, the door looks sealed shut.

You see her. 

For a small, trivial, incremental, millisecond moment – you see her.
Old linguistic patterns from before lodged deep in the memory, squeeze sharp at your synapses.


You lose a measure of what ignorance you had.

Once you were naive and unaware of how the world works, the cosmos churning just beyond your peripherals, now you are less so. You took a peek behind the veil, and what is known can not be unknown; your synapses shift and rewrite as you become wiser, and more aware – for better or for worse.

You pull the revolver from its hip holster, it feels comfortable in your hand. You step cautious but ready towards the end of the corridor. There are other doors off to the side but the lit candle illuminates the furthest.

The candle flame reaches its nadir and the room goes black. You rush forward past it into the next room. A once regal foyer now covered in rubble, drops of water slobber from gaps in the roof and an undescovered genus of tree grows sickly. A set of wide stairs gape open and upwards. Chandeliers dangle at the top  -- tonsils of the waiting maw.

A rat or seomthing scuttles somewhere near.

The cracking of weak floorboards betrays your approach. They echo loudly like a painful orchestra.

The words seem off, the patterns warped. You have trouble focusing. There is something about that piece of art you nevernoticed before.

You lose a measure of what ignorance you had.

\

A soft cascade of muck flows down each step, coating your shoes. You reach the zenith and find an intersection. To the left, a borken down door reveals a dressing room filled with coat racks and clothing. The center, a long and narrow hallway of portraits. To the right a green house windowed door.

\

You empty all six rounds into the figure. It's not the first time you've had to, and its what they trained you to do. But the police union won't have your back all the way out here. 

Then again, when is anyone coming to search this house? 

The figure falls over with a wooden thunk, and lies still. No scream to accompany it. No blood on your hands -- today.

You will get her back. You will not fail her.

\

[[Lawman]], you reload your service weapon and continue into the next room.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Illuminate the figure" tags="" position="3600,1600" size="100,100">(if: $Ignorance is 2)+(text-colour:#2ea3a3)[//You are Ignorant of the true nature of the world//]

\




\

You pull out your flashlight, company issue, and illuminate the figure that drew your attention. Unstartled by the banality of what you see you swiftly move on. You've patrolled a thousand buildings during the empty of night, and whenever the creeping hints of the supernatural tease you, you are quickly and forever reminded by the shining light that the truth is always far more ordinary.

\




\

You've navigated and eluded the law enough to know when to keep your cool. Regardless of who or what the figure is they won't see you as you crouch into a silent movement and creep past onto the next room.

\

\

'She will be returned.' The words reverberate in the cold chasm of your mind. You can get her back, keep the world right. You move into a large bedroom, checking your corners sloppily in the dark. An open window allows moonlight and wind a welcome. 

You take the money from your pocket. "I brought the money,' you whimper, revolver ready.

'Who is this girl to you?' The wind belows in fury.

Who is this girl to you?

\

A lost little [[sheep]], a citizen you have been charged with protecting,with watching over.

\

A [[victim]], someone the world failed to protect. All you can do is find her and bring some solace and closure, maybe even justice. If there even is any.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="sheep" tags="" position="4000,2000" size="100,100">(if: $Ignorance is 2)+(text-colour:#2ea3a3)[//You are Ignorant of the true nature of the world//]

\

The window slams shut and cackles in creaking wood and splitering glass.

'Murderer!'

'No,' your voice resonates with its usual defiance.

'Murderer!' another voice whispers from behind the curtains of a four poster bed from deepest antiquity. 

You wave the money, 'I brought it, brought it all, now give her back! I must bring her back!'

'You killed her,' comes the reply.

'No, look.'

You pull out the crumpled letter to check its well memorised words. 

You killed her.
You killed her.
You killed her.
You killed her.

You killed her' 

'I- I was just doing my job, i though- i thought she had a weapon.' You say meekly.

\

Your detective work has lead you here. The letter implies the girl might be saved. But whoever sent it doesnt know you already found the body. The dining room looks to be ransacked, cupboards open and silverware looted. Photoframes litter the dining table though, a macabre display. Each photo depicting a crime scene shot of the woman in her murdrered state. 

You pause at the impossible gallery.

\ 



Take a gulp from your minifridge bottle of cheap vodka to [[Calm your nerves]]

\

[[Check your case files]] to compare the photos to yours.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Repaint her" tags="" position="2300,3100" size="100,100">You cannot save her now, but her nature is malleable. You drench your hands in the field of painted flowers and smother her again and again until she is happy here.

\

You leave the room, her smiling face staring at you in certain thankfulnes.

\

You return to the waking world. You find conversation banal, the world boring. You fixate on the impossible creeping tendrils of of the otherworlds. You begin to study, to learn how to repaint the world around you.

\

Would someone else have fared different?

\

You follow the hallway into a large ransacked dinning room. Cupboards and drawers open and silverware long since stolen. The table is set though, recently. Your flashlight glares through polished wine glasses. A set of candles flicker. 

You hear the disctinctive sound of creaking footsteps behind you, the doors slam shut, the candles waver.

The one room to be spared the sodden death of a leaking roof, the moth eaten curtains catch fire and an inferno surrounds you in seconds.

You follow the hallway into a large ransacked dinning room. Cupboards and drawers open and silverware long since stolen. The table is set though, recently. The landscapes flares with vibrancy, of long lost horizons and worlds yet undescovered. A set of candles flicker. 

You hear the disctinctive sound of creaking footsteps behind you, the doors slam shut, the candles waver.

The one room to be spared the sodden death of a leaking roof, the moth eaten curtains catch fire and an inferno surrounds you in seconds.

\

The canvas room flickers rabid with the licks of flame. Enter the painting, become 'of it', [[cover yourself in the fire]] and continue.

The landscapes have seen the house, this room, in all its glory and delapidation. How do they see it now? a burning husk? or [[a resplendid banquet]] filled with merry guests.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Stare at the strangely shaped shadows on the wall" tags="" position="2700,700" size="100,100">(enchant:?page,(text-colour:white)+(bg:(gradient: 176, 0.3009,#000000,0.765,#247a7a)))

The walls lap up the twirling shapes, you see smiles unnatural.

You throw any caution or responsibility to the wind and ready your gun, prioritising your own safety over anyone elses.

Paranoia surely, but the house seems alive doesn't it?

You stubmle into another hallway dripping with a sickly mucus. The walls quiver like flesh and what light the broken ceiling allows exposes a pinkish hue to the walls. You traverse a worming array of roots and reach an ever slightly glowing blockade. 

An insects, a worms membrane. Barring the end of the hallway.

The bedroom is cold. The window shudders open and midnight air assaults you. A tall painting hangs above the bed. You see her standing there, back turned, within the painting. Her brushstrokes faded, wearing thin. You call out, you fumble with the wad of money in your pocket. She walks away into the distant, form dissovling.

You touch the moulded oil paint, it sinks inwards with years of decay and waterlog. But you cannot pass it. You take a step back and observe it again. Nothing more than an old landscape.

A note lies on the bed, the same paper as the letter crumpled up in your pocket. 

'Leave the money, and the girl is yours.'

You break through another door into a room that someone previosuly decided you probably shoudn't. You immediately realise why, the floor has sunk in and half rotted carpet reveals a break into the room below. You make for the nearest accesible door when slithering noise from below distracts you.

You killed her. Pig.

And you got away with it.

Did you really think you could get her back?

The door slams shut behind you, you twirl and empty the revolver chamber into it. Something grabs you from behind.

The window bursts open one more.

You feel a hot pain beneath your ribs.

You did your job, and at least you will die a hero, a servant of the people. A watchdog.

You killed her.

\

You lose a measure of what ignorance you had.

Once you were naive and unaware of how the world works, the cosmos churning just beyond your peripherals, now you are less so. You took a peek behind the veil, and what is known can not be unknown; your synapses shift and rewrite as you become wiser, and more aware – for better or for worse.

It will weigh on you, but perhaps less than whatever lied at the end of that house.

The candle flame reaches its nadir and the room goes black. You rush forward past it into the next room. A once regal foyer now covered in rubble, drops of water slobber from gaps in the roof and an undescovered genus of tree grows sickly. A set of wide stairs gape open and upwards. Chandeliers dangle at the top  -- tonsils of the waiting maw.

A rat or seomthing scuttles somewhere near.

The cracking of weak floorboards betrays your approach. They echo loudly like a painful orchestra.

You stubmle into another hallway dripping with a sickly mucus. The walls quiver like flesh and what light the broken ceiling allows exposes a pinkish hue to the walls. You traverse a worming array of roots and reach an ever slightly glowing blockade. 

An insects, a worms membrane. Barring the end of the hallway.


[[Attempt to step through it]]

\

There is fire at hand, [[burn your way through it]]

\

More paintings litter the walls, covered in tendrils. What do they see? a fields of wheat and insects [[shoo the insects as you pass through the swarm]]

(set: $Ignorance to $Ignorance +10)

A conflagration engulfs you and the membrane, you feel the sweet breath of burning flesh.

You lose a measure of what ignorance you had.

Once you were naive and unaware of how the world works, the cosmos churning just beyond your peripherals, now you are less so. You took a peek behind the veil, and what is known can not be unknown; your synapses shift and rewrite as you become wiser, and more aware – for better or for worse.

Enter the [[Bedroom]]

(set: $Ignorance to $Ignorance +10)

The insects cover your body and you feel their warmth as you pass through the swarm.

You lose a measure of what ignorance you had.

Enter the [[Bedroom]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="set fire to the painting" tags="" position="3000,3100" size="100,100">The fire takes hold quickly, and the walls pulsate in response. The painted girl screams, but she is lost now, a siren that must be left behind.

You run, pushing your burnt self back through the paintings canvas door.

Paint melts and splashes behind you -- a cascade.

\

You run and run, without glancing back. 

\

You return to your life. The girls screaming pigment haunts you. You have seen things, you know things. And no matter how hard you try you cant seem to distract yourself. Sometimes during conversation, your friends look at you strangely and you realise your sentences have slipped into ideas and thoughts of the otherworlds that they don't understand.

\

Would someone else have fared different?

[[A cold night on a twisting woodland road]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Scrape the pigment girl off" tags="" position="2700,3100" size="100,100">You scrape the beautiful form of the pigment girl off the wall. The thick layer of paint floppy in your arms as you leave.

\

You leave the house, successful, returning to your perfectly ordinary life.

She sits on your own bedroom wall now. A part of your own house. Your friends always stare baffled at her, and your explenations sound like nonsense to them.

Eventually they stop coming around. Some of them were not right anyway, you could see it, see the way the paint reacted to their presence.

Would someone else have fared different?
